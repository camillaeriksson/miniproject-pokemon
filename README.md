This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Poképedia

This is a web app where you can find all your favourite pokémons divided into color categories! 
In the navbar you will find all the colors to choose between. While in a specific category you can click on a pokémon card to get all the necessary info about that pokémon. If you like some pokémons more than others, you can favourise your pokémons just by clicking on the pokémon ball on your favourite card.

Go to your favourites by clicking on the pokémon ball in the navbar. There you will find a list of your favourite cards.

On top of this you will also be greeted with a "Pokémon of the day" on the start page. By clicking on the Pokémon of the day you will get info about it. This means you will discover a new pokémon every day!  
Go ahead and loose yourself in our Poképedia app.

# HOW TO BUILD AND RUN THE APP

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
